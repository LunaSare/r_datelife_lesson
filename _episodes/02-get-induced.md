The Synthetic Open Tree of Life summarizes information from 1216
trees from 1162 studies.

<!-- The latest one was created in 2019-12-23 11:41:23 -->

To access general information about the current synthetic otol, we can use the function `tol_about()`.
This function requires no argument.

This is nice!

But, **_what if we just want a small piece of the whole synthetic Open Tree of Life?_**

Well, now that we have some interesting taxon _ott ids_ we can interact with the synthetic Open Tree.

For this purpose, we will use functions starting with "tol_".

### Getting an induced subtree

The function `tol_induced_subtree()`` allows us to get a tree of various taxa at different taxonomic ranks.

Let's look at the output.

~~~
my_tree
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Phylogenetic tree with 5 tips and 4 internal nodes.

Tip labels:
[1] "Delphinidae_ott698406"  "mrcaott47497ott110766"  "Felis_ott563165"       
[4] "Spheniscidae_ott494367" "Amphibia_ott544595"    
Node labels:
[1] "Tetrapoda ott229562" "Amniota ott229560"   "mrcaott1548ott4697" 
[4] "mrcaott4697ott6940" 

Rooted; no branch lengths.

{: .output}

It is, indeed, a tree. Plot it.

~~~
ape::plot.phylo(my_tree, cex = 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-plot1-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot1" alt="plot of chunk plot1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is cool!

But, why did my _Canis_ disappear?

Well, it did not actually disappear, it was replaced by the label "mrcaott47497ott110766".

We will explain why this happens in the next section.

Now, **_what if you want a synthetic tree containing some or all descendants from your taxa of interest?_**

### Get a subtree of one taxon

We can extract a subtree of all descendants of one taxon at a time using the function `tol_subtree()` and the amphibians _ott id_.

Try to extract a subtree of all amphibians.
Its _ott id_  is already stored in the `resolved_names` object, but you can run the function `tnrs_match_names()` again if you want.

~~~
resolved_names["Amphibia",]$ott_id # extract the ott id from resolved_names
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 544595
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
amphibia_ott_id <- rotl::tnrs_match_names("amphibians")$ott_id # OR run tnrs again
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now, extract the subtree from the Open Tree synthetic tree using `tol_subtree()`.

~~~
amphibia_subtree <- rotl::tol_subtree(ott_id = resolved_names["Amphibia",]$ott_id)
~~~
{: .language-r}

~~~

This is a large tree! We will have a hard time plotting it.

Try to extract a subtree for the genus _Canis_. It should be way smaller!

~~~
{: .error}

## ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜±

What does this error mean??

A "broken" taxon error usually happens when phylogenetic information does not match taxonomic information.

For example, extinct lineages are sometimes phylogenetically included within a taxon but are taxonomically excluded, making the taxon appear as paraphyletic.

On the [Open Tree of Life browser](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@372706), we can still get to the subtree ([check it out here](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/opentree12.3@mrcaott47497ott110766)).

From R, we will need to do something else first.
