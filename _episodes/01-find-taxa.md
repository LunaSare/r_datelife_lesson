title: "Finding your taxa in the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "What is the Open Tree Taxonomy?"
- "What are _ott ids_?"
- 'What is "tnrs"?'
objectives:
- "Getting ott ids for some taxa."
- "Understanding tnrs approximate matching and its sensitivity."
- "Finding the utility of taxonomic contexts"
- "Discovering functions to handle a match_names object."
keypoints:
- "_ott ids_ are the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy handlers, they allow us to interact with the Open Tree synthetic tree."
- "taxonomic context is very important to find the correct _ott ids_ for our taxa."
- "You can go from a scientific name to an _ott id_ with tnrs matching."
- "But you can go from common name to scientific name format using other functions, to make your own workflow."

### The Open Tree Taxonomy and its identifiers

The Open Tree Taxonomy is

TNRS stands for Taxonomic NAme Resolution Service.

To get the _ott ids_ of your taxa we will use the function `tnrs_match_names()`. This will generate a "match_names" object.

### Taxonomic contexts and updating a "match_names" object

Running a tnrs match can take some time, so if you just want to update a few elements from your match_names object, you can use the functions `inspect()` and `update()`.

**Hack**

Put together two match_names objects

**Extra**

Going from common name to scientific name
