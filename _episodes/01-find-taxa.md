title: "Finding your taxa in the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "What is the Open Tree Taxonomy?"
- "What are _ott ids_?"
- 'What is "tnrs"?'
objectives:
- "Getting ott ids for some taxa."
- "Understanding tnrs approximate matching and its sensitivity."
# - "Finding the utility of taxonomic contexts"
# - 'Discovering functions to handle a "match_names" object.'
keypoints:
- "_ott ids_ are the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy handlers, they allow us to interact with the Open Tree synthetic tree."
# - "taxonomic context is very important to find the correct _ott ids_ for our taxa."
- "You can go from a scientific name to an _ott id_ with tnrs matching."
- "You cannot go from a common name to _ott id_."

### The Open Tree Taxonomy and its identifiers

The Open Tree Taxonomy stores information about taxa and assigns eaxh taxon a unique identifies which we cal the **_ott id_**.


To get the _ott ids_ of your taxa we will use the function `tnrs_match_names()`. This function generates a "match_names" object.

"tnrs" stands for Taxonomic Name Resolution Service.

<!-- ## **Challenge!** What do other elements of a "match_names" object tell us?

## Solution
{: .solution}
{: .challenge}


### Taxonomic contexts and updating a "match_names" object

Running a tnrs match can take some time, so if you just want to update a few elements from your match_names object, you can use the functions `inspect()` and `update()`.

The _Mus_ example is fixed.

## **Hack!**

Put together two "match_names" objects with `c()` or `rbind()`

> Going from common name to scientific name can be achieved with other tools. Check out [phylotastic](https://phylo.cs.nmsu.edu/) or [OneZoom](https://github.com/OneZoom/OZtree) APIs for that.
