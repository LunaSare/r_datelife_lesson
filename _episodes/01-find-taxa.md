title: "Find your taxa in the Open Tree of Life"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "What are ott ids?"
- "How do I get them?"
- "How do I check them and fix them?"
- "How do I use them?"
objectives:
- "Know about functions to handle ott ids, understand them and their outputs"
- "Learn about approximate matching ans its sensitivity "
- "Learn about taxonomic contexts and how to use them"
keypoints:
- "ott ids are the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy handlers, they allow us to intercat with the Open Tree synthetic tree"
- "Functions that help us find ott ids start with tnrs_ "
---




Get the _ott ids_ for your taxa with `tnrs_match_names()`. This will generate a "match_names" object.

There are two ways to extract the _ott ids_ from a "match_names" object:

~~~
rotl::ott_id(resolved_names) # as a list
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
$Amphibia
[1] 544595

$Canis
[1] 372706

$Felis
[1] 563165

$Delphinidae
[1] 698406

$Spheniscidae
[1] 494367

attr(,"class")
[1] "otl_ott_id" "list"      
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
resolved_names$ott_id # as a vector
