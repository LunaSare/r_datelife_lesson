title: "Finding your taxa in the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy"
teaching: 5
exercises: 5
questions:
- "What is the Open Tree Taxonomy?"
- "What are _ott ids_?"
- 'What is "tnrs"?'
objectives:
- "Get ott ids for some taxa."
- "Understand tnrs approximate matching and its sensitivity."
- "Try taxonomic contexts."
keypoints:
- "_ott ids_ are the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy handlers, they allow us to interact with the Open Tree synthetic tree."
- "taxonomic context is very important to find the correct _ott ids_ for our taxa."
- "You can go from a scientific name to an _ott id_ with tnrs matching."
- "But you can go from common name to scientific name format using other functions, to make your own workflow."

### The Open Tree Taxonomy and its identifiers


The Open Tree Taxonomy is

TNRS stands for Taxonomic NAme Resolution Service.

To get the _ott ids_ of your taxa we will use the function `tnrs_match_names()`. This will generate a "match_names" object.

~~~
my_taxa <- c("amphibians", "canis", "felis", "delphinidae", "spheniscidae")
resolved_names <- rotl::tnrs_match_names(my_taxa)
class(resolved_names)
~~~
{: .language-r}

Are you familiar with the elements of a match_names object?


There are two ways to extract the _ott ids_ from a match_names object.

As a list, with the function `ott_id()`:


~~~
rotl::ott_id(resolved_names) # as a list
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
$Amphibia
[1] 544595

$Canis
[1] 372706

$Felis
[1] 563165

$Delphinidae
[1] 698406

$Spheniscidae
[1] 494367

attr(,"class")
[1] "otl_ott_id" "list"      
~~~
{: .output}

Or, as a vector:


~~~
resolved_names$ott_id # as a vector
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 544595 372706 563165 698406 494367
~~~
{: .output}

Most of the functions we will use need _ott ids_ as a vector, so I will prefer the second approach.

**Hack**:

To facilitate the use of _ott ids_ later, you can name the rows of your match_names object.


~~~
rownames(resolved_names) <- resolved_names$unique_name
~~~
{: .language-r}

Like this, we can access _ott ids_ by their taxon name.


~~~
resolved_names$ott_id["Amphibia"]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}

You can access other elements of the match)names object with functions `flag`


### Taxonomic contexts and updating a "match_names" object

Running a tnrs match can take some time, so if you just want to update a few elememnts from your match_names object, you can use the functions
